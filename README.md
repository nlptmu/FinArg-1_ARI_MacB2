## The introduction of FinArg-1_ARI  
---------------------------------------------------
The global financial landscape's complexity and volatility necessitate robust methodologies and tools for decision-making and risk management. With the rapid evolution of financial technology and the rise of natural language models, we're entering a transformative era in fintech. Traditionally, fintech focused on data analytics for efficient services. However, thanks to advances in natural language processing (NLP), the focus has shifted to textual data, unlocking unprecedented opportunities. Textual sources like news articles, social media, and market commentary offer rich market insights. NLP enables us to extract valuable forecasts and insights for investors, risk managers, and financial professionals.
Previous financial NLP studies mainly focused on binary sentence classifications for stock market predictions, but this narrow approach falls short of meeting the industry's demand for multifaceted analyses. Recognizing the limitations of traditional quantitative models, sentiment NLP analysis is crucial for understanding market forces.
In finance, understanding market sentiment remains a cornerstone of decision-making, influenced by economic metrics, geopolitics, and market narratives. Researchers are exploring the value of financial texts and simulating investors' thought processes. This convergence of linguistics, behavioral finance, and technology is reshaping financial analysis.
In light of this, our focus has pivoted towards examining inter-sentential relationships within financial narratives, aiming to capture correlations between financial events in a more comprehensive and detailed manner. Specifically, our task aims to identify the attack and support argumentative relationships in the social media discussion thread. Instead of analyzing a single social media post, we consider the whole discussion thread. In this task, we attempt to link the posts with attack and support labels. With these labels, we can understand the argumentation structure among opinions. We are confident that through this exploration, we are better equipped to tackle the challenges of the financial market and bolster sustainable growth in the sector.
